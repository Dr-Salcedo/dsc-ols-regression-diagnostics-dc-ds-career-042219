    "So far, you have looked mainly at R-Squared values along with some visualization techniques to confirm if the data and residuals fit the regression assumptions. Now, you'll look at some statistical procedures to further understand your model and results. You'll be looking at the results obtained in the regression analysis outcomes for the advertising dataset in the previous lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Some of the terms in this lesson highlighting underlying statistical testing concepts will be new to you. These terms will be covered in detail in later sections. Here, the focus will be on running and interpreting the results of these tests in a regression context.*\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Use Q-Q plots to check for the normality in residual errors\n",
    "* Use the Jarque-Bera test for normal distribution of residuals\n",
    "* Check for heteroscedasticity using the Goldfeld-Quandt test to check whether the variance is the same in 2 samples"

    "Regression diagnostics is a set of procedures available for regression analysis that assess the validity of a model in a number of different ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be:\n",
    "- An exploration of the model's underlying statistical assumptions\n",
    "- An examination of the structure of the model by considering formulations that have less, more or different explanatory variables\n",
    "- A study of subgroups of observations, looking for those that are either poorly represented by the model (outliers) or that have a relatively large effect on the regression model's predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "For a thorough overview, you can go and have a look at the [wikipedia page on regression diagnostics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_diagnostic)\n",

    "## Normality Check (Q-Q plots) \n",
    "You've already seen Q-Q Plots as a measure to check for normality (or, by extension, any other distribution). \n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Q plots are also referred to as normal density plots when used with standard normal quantiles. These plots are a good way to inspect the distribution of model errors. You saw this earlier with the small height-weight data set. Let's quickly plot a Q-Q for the residuals in the `sales ~ TV` and the `sales ~ radio` models again!"

In other words, this means that the normality null hypothesis has been rejected at the $5\\%$ significance level. A value close to 0 on the contrary, indicates the data $is$ normally distributed. We have already seen the JB test using `model.summary()`. The code below shows you how to run this test on its own."
